IMPORTANT: Due to the limitations of starter Spotify applications, new users cannot login to my app before I manually register them.
Please watch the video demo if I have not registered you.
I have applied for a status upgrade for my app, which would resolve this limitation if Spotify grants it.

Functionality: 
Displays Spotify user's top 50 tracks and artists, with adjustable time frames.
Shows popularity scores for tracks and artists when hovering over pictures.
Generates new track recommendations using top tracks/artists, with randomized refreshing and in-site listening.
