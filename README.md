IMPORTANT: Due to the limitations of Spotify applications in development mode, new users cannot login to my app before I manually register them.
Instead, please watch the video demo of me using it at the youtube link below.
Since my app is a personal project, I was unable to obtain production mode from Spotify.

Functionality: 
Displays Spotify user's top 50 tracks and artists, with adjustable time frames.
Shows popularity scores for tracks and artists when hovering over pictures.
Generates new track recommendations using top tracks/artists, with in-site song listening.

All project files are in /callback.
HTML are at the top, Javascript and CSS are in /callback/src.
